# Lottery-Simulator  
This is a practice lottery simulator that can be set to your likings.  
**Note:**  
      -This is not a real lottery, you cant actually play it but just see the "real" odds to win a lottery.   
      -There is no kind of mega ball.        
       
      
**How to use:**      
          
balls_amount: in a real lottery there are different balls to set the lottery outcome, the same here.  
You can simply set the amount of balls used in this simulation.  
The tries needed for winning increase drastically with every ball and the execution time as well       
      
max_number_amount: sets the max amount of numbers on every ball.  
Higher values increase the execution time   
  
lotteries_amount: this sets how often your lottery should be done.  
If you set it on five for example, it will do five lotteries and calculate the avg tries at the end.   
    
print_intermediate_results: True: prints the results of every lottery | False: just prints the avg tries at the end   
Its recommended to turn this on, but it will always increase the execution time.
